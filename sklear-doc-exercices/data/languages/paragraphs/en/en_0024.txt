Wikipedia's initial anarchy integrated democratic and hierarchical elements over time.[94][95] An article is not considered to be owned by its creator or any other editor, nor by the subject of the article.[96] Wikipedia's contributors avoid a tragedy of the commons (behaving contrary to the common good) by internalizing benefits. They do this by experiencing flow (i.e., energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment) and identifying with and gaining status in the Wikipedia community.[97]
